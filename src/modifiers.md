# Modifiers

Modifiers are methods that transform one IVP into another IVP by adding certain
functionalities.
They are pretty intuitive and allow.

We emphasize that the order of modifiers is important. In some cases,
code won't even compile if you switch the order.

## Important Modifiers

This is not an exhaustive list, but we include some commonly used modifiers here.
We hope to add more modifiers in the future to allow for futher customization of views.
